# 42-ft_printf

This is the **9th version** of 42's ft_printf project, where we recode in C the original printf.<br>
The greatest point of this project is to understand the usage of variadic functions and in order to do it, we have to work with the macros va_start, va_arg, va_copy and va_end, which belongs to STDARG.H.<br>
On this version, the placeholders that are needed mimic to finish the mandatory part are %c, %s, %p, %d, %u, %i, %x, %X and %.

This is the **9th version** of 42's ft_printf project, where we recode in C the original printf.
  
The greatest point of this project is to understand the usage of variadic functions and in order to do it, we have to work with the macros va_start, va_arg, va_copy and va_end, which belongs to STDARG.H.
  
On this version, the placeholders that are needed mimic to finish the mandatory part are %c, %s, %p, %d, %u, %i, %x, %X and %.
